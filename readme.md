# Supabase Flutter Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for a Supabase Flutter application. It includes a login, registration, and forgot password page, dark and light theme, and a home page.

## Some notes

This is my first flutter project. It's far from perfect. But I thought it might be a good starting point. Many example projects are heavily over-engineered in my opinion, which makes it hard to understand the basics.

## Features

- Login
- Registration
- Forgot Password
- Dark and Light Theme
- Home Page
- Supabase Auth

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Rename with `dart run change_app_package_name:main com.example.your_app_name`
4. Replace the supabase url and anon key in `lib/shared/config/app_config.dart`
5. Run `flutter clean`
6. Run `flutter pub get`
7. Run `flutter run -d chrome --web-port=8989` for web
